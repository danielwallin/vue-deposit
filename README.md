### Deposit payment page

This is a learn by doing project where I used the Vue.js framework in conjunction with using the [docs.paymentiq.io](https://docs.paymentiq.io) payment API.

**Todos**
- The field rules and validation should be using schemas returned from the backend instead of having the client try to conform to its rulesets.
- Abstract away more elements to its own components.
- Import css helpers.
- Make it responsive.
- Use a state management library such as Vuex instead of relying on higher order components.
- Learn more about Vue and the API in general.
